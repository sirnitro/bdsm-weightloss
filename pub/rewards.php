        <h2>Rewards</h2>
    <p>
        Every weight loss plan should have rewards, and every submissive should also be rewarded. BDSM is not just about discipline; rewarding is a major component. Set milestones, and when the milestones are hit, a reward should be given. The type of submissive can help formulate your rewards. For example, if your submissive is a “little,” then maybe a new stuffie; however, a new stuffie may not work for other submissives. Negotiate and figure this out together using the worksheets we provide.
