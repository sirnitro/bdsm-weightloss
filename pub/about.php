        <h2>About BDSM Weight Loss</h2>
    <div class="content">
    <p>
        BDSM is uniquely qualified to help people lose weight. I’m personally familiar with many women who have successfully lost a surprising amount of weight using this system. If you are not familiar with BDSM (Bondage, Discipline, Sadism, and/or Masochism), please do an Internet search or otherwise learn more about it (should that be your wish).
    </p>
    <p>
        As you know, losing weight is an arduous, restrictive, and sacrifice-filled experience that isn’t particularly fun. To combat this, the dieter needs a lot of motivation. Happily, BDSM can be of great service in this regard.
    </p>
    <p>
        Integral to successful weight loss using BDSM is that the dieter needs to be submissive to the Dominant and relinquish control to him over the aspects of her life that affect her weight loss, such as her dieting. (Review our case studies.)
    </p>
    <p>
        As a Master, I have overseen many female submissive/slaves’ BDSM weight loss programs, often with very good success. There is no doubt that this kind of BDSM weight loss program can be a first-rate weight loss plan. It has proven itself many times.
    </p>
    <p>The biggest problems, however, are that the dieter (the submissive):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Decides against continuing with the restrictions of the weight loss program (such as the diet).</li>
        <li>Rebels against the dominance of her Dominant. (If this occurs, likely all is lost.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Talk to each other about this in the beginning and again as necessary. Be prepared for it so you can address it when (and if) it occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this weight loss program, the Dominant will exercise strict control over what the submissive eats and will punish her for infractions as he feels necessary. She must not rebel against this, or the weight loss program likely won’t succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The submissive also needs to be honest with herself and with her Dom. She cannot eat foods (or excess amounts of food) that she isn’t allowed to and then lie about it. Should she fail in this regard, she should be punished, and she needs to accept that.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, during the BDSM Weight Loss Program, one or more of these problems may manifest:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>A)</strong> Life throws her a curveball, and the dieter has to get off the weight loss program. In that case, let it go and restart it ASAP.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>B)</strong> People generally don’t like to be told they’re overweight, no matter how true it is, so even discussing it can be a sensitive subject. This sensitivity includes times when the BDSM Weight Loss Program is ongoing. It’s very helpful if the submissive works past this and understands that it’s natural to think her Dominant has a negative view of her current body, even if that’s not the case.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I recall a time I put a slave on a BDSM weight loss program, and she rebelled after only six days. I’m confident it was not my fault. We ended up ending our online relationship because of this. However, a couple of months later, she contacted me and happily shared that she had restarted dieting and lost a significant amount of weight.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even though I had initially inspired and required her to begin the program, she no longer associated her weight loss success with me. This felt unfair in my opinion.
    </p>
    <p>Other potential challenges include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>C)</strong> The Dominant is not good at this, and the submissive feels the need to break it off. Perhaps he’s not a good Dom to begin with, or she doesn’t respect him as much as they had thought. (It can help if the Dom is in decent physical shape and exercises himself, though this is comparatively minor.)
        </li>
        <li><strong>D)</strong> The submissive doesn’t want to lose weight badly enough.</li>
        <li><strong>E)</strong> She rebels against specific demands of this strict regimen.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The Dominant must know how much (and how hard) to push her. If she is especially sensitive to this type of control, the program is likely doomed to failure.
