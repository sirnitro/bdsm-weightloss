For a more nuanced peppery flavor, use a mix of rosé, white, green and black pepper corns and crush them with a mortar and pestel. Use the crushed pepper corns for both seasoning the meat and to flavor the sauce</p>

		<p>Try these incredible <a href=""https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto"">keto</a> cottage cheese pancakes and you’ll never go back to regular flapjacks! Our berry topping gives them just the right amount of sweetness and the kids will love them too!</p>	</p>
	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-equipment"">
			</div>
	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-ingredients"">
		<h4>Pancakes</h4><ul><li>4 eggs</li><li>7 oz. 1 cup cottage cheese</li><li>1 tbsp ground psyllium husk powder</li><li>2 oz. butter or coconut oil (for frying)</li></ul><h4>Toppings</h4><ul><li>2 oz. fresh raspberries or fresh blueberries or fresh strawberries</li><li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li></ul>	</div>
	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions"">
		<ol><li>Add eggs, cottage cheese, and psyllium husk to a medium-size bowl and mix together. Let sit for 5-10 minutes to thicken up a bit.</li><li>Heat the butter or oil, in a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Fry the pancakes for 3–4 minutes, per side. Don't make them too big or they will be hard to flip.</li><li>Add cream to a separate bowl and whip until soft peaks form.</li><li>Serve the pancakes with the whipped cream and berries of your choice.</li></ol>	</div>
	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-notes"">
		<h3>Tip!</h3>
<p>If you want a really fluffy pancake, and don't mind spending a few more minutes making them, you can separate the eggs. Use the egg yolks as the instructions say but whip up the egg whites in a separate bowl. Add the egg whites to the batter, carefully folding them in so that the air you whipped into them doesn't get knocked out.</p>
<p>These pancakes are also a great snack served cold. Wrap a few up and bring them to work with you!</p>
<h3>Serving suggestions</h3>
<p>If you feel like serving them with something other than <a href=""https://www.dietdoctor.com/recipes/berries-whipped-cream"">berries and whipped cream</a>, we suggest trying our <a href=""https://www.dietdoctor.com/recipes/instant-low-carb-raspberry-jam"">raspberry jam</a>, <a href=""https://www.dietdoctor.com/recipes/keto-buttercream"">butter cream</a> or <a href=""https://www.dietdoctor.com/recipes/keto-chocolate-hazelnut-spread"">hazelnut spread</a>.</p>
<h3>Storing and reheating</h3>
<p>These pancakes taste best when they are freshly made but keep well in the fridge for 2-3 days. You can also store them in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p>
<p>If you want to store them stacked on top of each other you probably want to place a piece of parchment paper between each pancake, or they'll stick together.</p>
<p>The best way to reheat the pancakes is to melt a small knob of butter in a pan on medium heat and place the pancakes in there. It only takes about 30 seconds on each side to heat them up.</p>

		<p>Butter on a burger? We’re sold! Traditionally, it’s a Midwestern staple but we ditched the bun and made it irresistibly <a href=""https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto"">keto</a>. Crispy edges, juicy bites... just perfect for the grill.</p>	</p>
	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-equipment"">

		<ul><li>1 lb 80/20 ground beef or ground turkey</li><li>1 tsp salt</li><li>½ tsp ground black pepper</li><li>¼ 1 oz. red onion, finely chopped</li><li>1 fresh jalapeño (cut in small pieces)</li><li>1 4 oz. tomato, thinly sliced</li><li>1 7 oz. avocado, cut lengthwise</li><li>1 butterhead lettuce</li><li>8 slices cheddar cheese</li><li>1½ oz. butter (in slices)</li></ul>	</div>
	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions"">
		<ol><li>Preheat the grill for 20 minutes on medium heat with the lid down. If you don't have a grill, you can also prepare these delicious burgers on the stovetop. Just fry the burgers in some butter in a frying pan for a few minutes on each side.</li><li>In a bowl, combine the ground beef, salt, and pepper.</li><li>Finely chop the onion and cut the jalapeño into small pieces. Remove the seeds first if you don’t want it to be too spicy. Add onion and jalapeño to the meat and combine thoroughly with your hands.</li><li>Form one hamburger patties per portion. First, shape them into a ball and then slowly press down. If you make them on the grill, leave them a bit thicker because they cook fast.</li><li>Grill the patties for 5-7 minutes on each side, depending on how well done you want them. Allow them to rest for 10 minutes before serving so the juices can settle.</li><li>While the burgers are on the grill, thinly slice the tomato. Cut the avocado lengthwise, remove the pit and spoon out the flesh.</li><li>To assemble, take 3-4 lettuce leaves for each burger. Place burger in the middle, top each with slices of cheese and a slice of butter. Add the tomato and avocado, season with salt and pepper. Try to wrap the burger so you can easily grab it.</li></ol>	</div>
	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-notes"">
		<p>The onion and the jalapeños are not gonna cook all the way on the grill, they’ll be a bit crunchy. If you want them to be fully-cooked, you can pre-cook them in a skillet before you mix them in the ground meat mixture.</p>
<p>For some extra flavor, add 1/2 tsp garlic powder or some fresh minced garlic in the meat mixture.</p>
<p>Feel free to serve the burgers with homemade ketchup, homemade BBQ sauce or a lovely spicy mayo.</p>

Juicy steak bites, fried to perfection in garlic butter, served with fresh veggies, and last but not least... a dressing to die for! After tasting the dressing you will want to use it on everything.</p>	</p>
	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-equipment"">

		<h4>Tarragon dressing</h4><ul><li>1 ⁄3 cup mayonnaise or vegan mayonnaise</li><li>2 tbsp water</li><li>½ tbsp dried tarragon</li><li>½ tbsp Dijon mustard</li><li>1 garlic clove (pressed)</li></ul><h4>Salad</h4><ul><li>4 cups 8 oz. leafy greens</li><li>8 oz. cherry tomatoes</li><li>1 7 oz. avocado</li><li>6 oz. cucumber</li></ul><h4>Garlic steak bites</h4><ul><li>2 lbs flank steak or ribeye steaks or sirloin steak (cut into 1"" (2.5 cm) pieces)</li><li>2 tbsp ghee or butter</li><li>3 garlic cloves (finely chopped)</li><li>salt and ground black pepper (to taste)</li></ul>	</div>

		<ol><li>Whisk together the dressing ingredients in a bowl and refrigerate.</li><li>Prep the salad as you please and arrange the veggies on a big serving plate or on individual plates.</li><li>Heat up a large frying pan on high heat. Add the ghee or butter. When melted, add the meat and season generously with salt and ground black pepper. When the meat starts to get some color, add the garlic and mix it around. Fry just until the meat is browned on all sides. You don't want to overcook it, then the meat will get chewy.</li><li>Top the salad with the steak bites, garlic, and meat drippings from the pan. Drizzle the dressing on top or serve it on the side.</li></ol>	</div>
	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-notes"">
		<p>What is ghee?<br />
Ghee is clarified butter meaning that the milk protein has been removed. This makes it perfect for frying on high temperatures since it won't burn as easily as butter.</p>
<p>Budget tips<br />
Ask the butcher if they have steak bites you could buy. Some butchers will charge a lot less for steak bites even if the cut is typically more expensive since the pieces are too small to sell as a full steak.</p>
<p>I don't eat red meat<br />
You could replace the meat with any meat of your preference. For example chicken, pork tenderloin, lamb or even fish or shrimps. Just make sure to adjust the cooking methods accordingly.</p>
<p>Want juicer steak bites?<br />
If you choose a less tender cut of meat like flank, you can marinate in advance to tenderize and flavor the meat. A combination of tamari, vinegar, olive oil, garlic powder, dried parsley works very nicely with this dish.</p>

		<p>It&#039;s no surprise that this fuss-free and hearty <em>Keto crack chicken</em> has gone viral. The classic combination of cream cheese, ranch seasoning, and bacon is always a winner. The slow cooker method is a breeze, but we&#039;ve also provided you with oven cooking and instant pot instructions in the tips, done in under 30 minutes!</p>	</p>
	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-equipment"">

	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions"">
		<ol><li>Mix the ranch seasoning, salt (if the ranch seasoning doesn't already contain salt), and cream cheese in a bowl. Place the chicken in the bottom of the slow cooker.

	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-notes"">
		<p>Storing<br />
This dish keeps fresh in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to a week. It also freezes well for up to three months. Since it contains a lot of dairy products it's always a good idea to thaw it on low heat to keep it from separating.</p>
<p>Ranch seasoning<br />
Store-bought ranch seasoning usually contains a lot of additives and hidden sugar so we recommend making your own, trust us, it's worth it.</p>
<p>Cooking crack chicken in the oven<br />
This is the perfect hack if you don't want to wait for hours before dinner is on the table or if you don't have a slow cooker at home but still want to make this dish.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).<br />
Shred the meat from a rotisserie chicken and remove the skin. OR boil the chicken fillets in chicken broth for 20 minutes under the lid and shred them using two forks when done.<br />
Mix the meat together with the ranch seasoning, salt, cream cheese, and half of the cheese. Put it in a baking dish. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and cooked bacon.<br />
Bake for 15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.<br />
Garnish with chives and ground black pepper.<br />
Cooking crack chicken in the instant pot<br />
Love your instant pot? We've got you covered.</p>
<p>Mix the cream cheese mixture as stated in step 1.<br />
Place chicken breasts at the bottom of your instant pot. Spread the cream cheese mixture on top.<br />
Close the lid and the vent and cook on high for 15 minutes. Let steam naturally release for 10 min. Open lid and stir, let the sauce thicken for a few minutes.<br />
Garnish with chives and ground black pepper.</p>

		<p class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-summary"">
		<p>It&#039;s no surprise that this fuss-free and hearty <em>Keto crack chicken</em> has gone viral. The classic combination of cream cheese, ranch seasoning, and bacon is always a winner. The slow cooker method is a breeze, but we&#039;ve also provided you with oven cooking and instant pot instructions in the tips, done in under 30 minutes!</p>	</p>
	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-equipment"">

		<ul><li>2 lbs chicken breasts</li><li>10 oz. 1¼ cups cream cheese</li><li>2 tbsp ranch seasoning</li><li>1 tsp salt</li><li>5 oz. bacon (diced)</li><li>1 cup 4 oz. cheddar cheese</li><li>2 tbsp fresh chives (chopped)</li><li>¼ tsp ground black pepper</li><li>3 cups 3 oz. baby spinach</li></ul>	</div>
	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions"">
		<ol><li>Mix the ranch seasoning, salt (if the ranch seasoning doesn't already contain salt), and cream cheese in a bowl. Place the chicken in the bottom of the slow cooker. Spread out the cream cheese mix on top of the chicken.</li><li>Cover with lid and set on low for 5 hours, or on high for 3 hours.</li><li>Fry the bacon on medium-high heat in a frying pan until crispy. Set aside.</li><li>Shred the chicken using two forks. Mix everything together. Sprinkle with cheese and bacon and cover with the lid until the cheese has melted.</li><li>Sprinkle with chives and ground black pepper. Serve together with baby spinach.</li></ol>	</div>
	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-notes"">
		<p>Storing<br />
This dish keeps fresh in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to a week. It also freezes well for up to three months. Since it contains a lot of dairy products it's always a good idea to thaw it on low heat to keep it from separating.</p>
<p>Ranch seasoning<br />
Store-bought ranch seasoning usually contains a lot of additives and hidden sugar so we recommend making your own, trust us, it's worth it.</p>
<p>Cooking crack chicken in the oven<br />
This is the perfect hack if you don't want to wait for hours before dinner is on the table or if you don't have a slow cooker at home but still want to make this dish.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).<br />
Shred the meat from a rotisserie chicken and remove the skin. OR boil the chicken fillets in chicken broth for 20 minutes under the lid and shred them using two forks when done.<br />
Mix the meat together with the ranch seasoning, salt, cream cheese, and half of the cheese. Put it in a baking dish. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and cooked bacon.<br />
Bake for 15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.<br />
Garnish with chives and ground black pepper.<br />
Cooking crack chicken in the instant pot<br />
Love your instant pot? We've got you covered.</p>
<p>Mix the cream cheese mixture as stated in step 1.<br />
Place chicken breasts at the bottom of your instant pot. Spread the cream cheese mixture on top.<br />
Close the lid and the vent and cook on high for 15 minutes. Let steam naturally release for 10 min. Open lid and stir, let the sauce thicken for a few minutes.<br />
Garnish with chives and ground black pepper.</p>

	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-notes"">
		<p>What is ghee?<br />
Ghee is clarified butter meaning that the milk protein has been removed. This makes it perfect for frying on high temperatures since it won't burn as easily as butter.</p>
<p>Budget tips<br />
Ask the butcher if they have steak bites you could buy. Some butchers will charge a lot less for steak bites even if the cut is typically more expensive since the pieces are too small to sell as a full steak.</p>
<p>I don't eat red meat<br />
You could replace the meat with any meat of your preference. For example chicken, pork tenderloin, lamb or even fish or shrimps. Just make sure to adjust the cooking methods accordingly.</p>
<p>Want juicer steak bites?<br />
If you choose a less tender cut of meat like flank, you can marinate in advance to tenderize and flavor the meat. A combination of tamari, vinegar, olive oil, garlic powder, dried parsley works very nicely with this dish.</p>

If you prefer an even creamier sauce, add a couple of tablespoons of cream cheese to the saucepan and let it simmer until creamy.</p>
<p>Pepper love<br />
For a more nuanced peppery flavor, use a mix of rosé, white, green and black pepper corns and crush them with a mortar and pestel. Use the crushed pepper corns for both seasoning the meat and to flavor the sauce</p>

		<h4>Pancakes</h4><ul><li>4 eggs</li><li>7 oz. 1 cup cottage cheese</li><li>1 tbsp ground psyllium husk powder</li><li>2 oz. butter or coconut oil (for frying)</li></ul><h4>Toppings</h4><ul><li>2 oz. fresh raspberries or fresh blueberries or fresh strawberries</li><li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li></ul>	</div>
	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions"">
		<ol><li>Add eggs, cottage cheese, and psyllium husk to a medium-size bowl and mix together.

	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-notes"">
		<h3>Tip!</h3>
<p>If you want a really fluffy pancake, and don't mind spending a few more minutes making them, you can separate the eggs. Use the egg yolks as the instructions say but whip up the egg whites in a separate bowl. Add the egg whites to the batter, carefully folding them in so that the air you whipped into them doesn't get knocked out.</p>
<p>These pancakes are also a great snack served cold. Wrap a few up and bring them to work with you!</p>
<h3>Serving suggestions</h3>
<p>If you feel like serving them with something other than <a href=""https://www.dietdoctor.com/recipes/berries-whipped-cream"">berries and whipped cream</a>, we suggest trying our <a href=""https://www.dietdoctor.com/recipes/instant-low-carb-raspberry-jam"">raspberry jam</a>, <a href=""https://www.dietdoctor.com/recipes/keto-buttercream"">butter cream</a> or <a href=""https://www.dietdoctor.com/recipes/keto-chocolate-hazelnut-spread"">hazelnut spread</a>.</p>
<h3>Storing and reheating</h3>
<p>These pancakes taste best when they are freshly made but keep well in the fridge for 2-3 days. You can also store them in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p>
<p>If you want to store them stacked on top of each other you probably want to place a piece of parchment paper between each pancake, or they'll stick together.</p>
<p>The best way to reheat the pancakes is to melt a small knob of butter in a pan on medium heat and place the pancakes in there. It only takes about 30 seconds on each side to heat them up.</p>

	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions"">
		<ol><li>Whisk together the dressing ingredients in a bowl and refrigerate.</li><li>Prep the salad as you please and arrange the veggies on a big serving plate or on individual plates.</li><li>Heat up a large frying pan on high heat. Add the ghee or butter. When melted, add the meat and season generously with salt and ground black pepper. When the meat starts to get some color, add the garlic and mix it around. Fry just until the meat is browned on all sides. You don't want to overcook it, then the meat will get chewy.</li><li>Top the salad with the steak bites, garlic, and meat drippings from the pan. Drizzle the dressing on top or serve it on the side.</li></ol>	</div>
	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-notes"">
		<p>What is ghee?<br />
Ghee is clarified butter meaning that the milk protein has been removed. This makes it perfect for frying on high temperatures since it won't burn as easily as butter.</p>
<p>Budget tips<br />
Ask the butcher if they have steak bites you could buy. Some butchers will charge a lot less for steak bites even if the cut is typically more expensive since the pieces are too small to sell as a full steak.</p>
<p>I don't eat red meat<br />
You could replace the meat with any meat of your preference. For example chicken, pork tenderloin, lamb or even fish or shrimps. Just make sure to adjust the cooking methods accordingly.</p>
<p>Want juicer steak bites?<br />
If you choose a less tender cut of meat like flank, you can marinate in advance to tenderize and flavor the meat. A combination of tamari, vinegar, olive oil, garlic powder, dried parsley works very nicely with this dish.</p>

		<p>A flank steak is a versatile cut of meat with a rich, beefy flavor and a lower cost. Spiced with a pepper sauce and paired with an attractive and easy gratin of cauliflower and broccoli, the result is a nutritious, satisfying meal that you will return to time and again.</p>	</p>
	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-equipment"">

	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions"">
		<ol><li>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Butter an 8 x 8"" (20 x 20 cm) baking dish.</li><li>Clean and trim the broccoli and cauliflower.

	<div class=""wprm-fallback-recipe-notes"">
		<p>Time saver<br />
Use frozen broccoli and cauliflower florets to save some time. Thaw and skip steps 2 and 3. Just mix with heavy cream, cheese and salt and place in the baking dish.</p>
<p>Creamier sauce<br />
If you prefer an even creamier sauce, add a couple of tablespoons of cream cheese to the saucepan and let it simmer until creamy.</p>
<p>Pepper love<br />
For a more nuanced peppery flavor, use a mix of rosé, white, green and black pepper corns and crush them with a mortar and pestel. Use the crushed pepper corns for both seasoning the meat and to flavor the sauce</p>
