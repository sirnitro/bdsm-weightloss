        <h2>Information for the Dom</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To start out with, the submissive needs to accept that she needs to lose weight. 
            (Hopefully, she adamantly wants to lose weight.) The other option is that her Dom/Domme 
            has told her to, and she is going to obey him.
        </li>
        <li>
            She might first try the usual methods of losing and keeping weight off, and hopefully, that works. 
            If those attempts aren’t fruitful enough, or if she wants to try another type of weight loss program 
            from the get-go, then the BDSM Weight Loss Program is definitely a way to go.
        </li>
        <li>
            If possible, determine just what the weight loss program’s specifics will be. It doesn’t need to be 
            complex or extreme. BDSM weight loss typically is a combination of exercise, good sleep, an acceptable 
            level of stress, and diet/calorie restrictions. The more sex she can have during this time, typically the better. 
            Does she have a convenient way to exercise? Does she know where to get low-calorie food?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The lack of optimal gut microbes has been tentatively linked to many overweight people, so perhaps a 
                    probiotic should be taken. Beware that most, if not all, of the live bacteria in a probiotic supplement 
                    are killed by stomach acid, so get one that can best survive stomach acid on its way to the colon, where 
                    it has important work to do.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Low-calorie yogurt has at least somewhat of a probiotic effect.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Can she afford Nutrisystems, Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, Medifast, or something of that nature? 
            If so, you’ll likely want to go with that.
        </li>
        <li>
            Does she understand nutrition well enough to know the allowable foods to eat? Most women do. 
            If not, her Dom will have to have even stricter control over the food she eats.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tell the sub/slave on what day the program begins. Give her at least one day to party a bit and 
            experience the culinary freedom that she won’t have for some time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Maintenance spankings can be a good idea during the weight loss program. This helps the submissive’s 
            conscious and/or subconscious mind remember the importance of respecting her commitment to the program 
            and the authority of her Dom, who will oversee it and punish her (and reward her) when she fails to 
            keep her end of the bargain. 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Definition of a Maintenance Spanking:</strong> Spankings administered on a regular basis 
                    to keep the spankee on the straight and narrow. (Punishment spankings are administered in addition to these.)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Provide encouragement for the submissive and perhaps give her extra time to work out by doing 
            certain chores that take up her time and/or energy.
        </li>
        <li>
            At some point down the road, she can start increasing her calorie intake, but that should be after 
            significant weight loss or if there are health issues.
        </li>
        <li>
            In most cases, it’s helpful for weight loss if she speeds up her metabolism in some healthy way.
        </li>
        <li>
            Important, don’t forget about rewarding her for her weight loss accomplishments. Be liberal with the rewards. 
            She’ll likely really appreciate those, and rewards may be the difference in the success or failure of her adherence 
            to the program. 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I personally would not include higher-calorie treats as a reward, but it’s up to you. 
                    The sub/slave should feel free to remind her Dom about the rewards from time to time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Be generous with minor rewards like watching something she wants to on TV or fixing a nice low-calorie 
                    dinner for her. Throw in bigger rewards periodically, like a night out or a special article of clothing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rule: Rewards cannot be taken away as punishment. Once she’s been punished, it’s over, and the slate has been wiped clean.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Getting her a new sex toy(s) can be a good reward. Periodically, take her out to eat where she can have a moderate-calorie meal.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Compliments – We all know how much women love compliments. Doms, don’t forget to compliment her for her 
            hard work regarding the weight loss program.
